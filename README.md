# 🌱 Smart Plant Care Assistant

An AI-powered plant health monitoring tool that helps users detect plant diseases and suggests care actions using simple image classification techniques — built entirely **locally** using Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit.

> 🔧 Built for: Microsoft AI + Azure (Edunet Foundation) Internship  
> 🚫 No cloud dependencies (runs 100% locally)

## 🌿 About the Project

The **Smart Plant Care Assistant** aims to support home gardeners, farmers, and plant lovers by providing instant health diagnosis of plants via leaf image classification. It can identify whether a plant is **healthy** or **unhealthy**, and recommend basic care tips such as watering, increasing sunlight, or checking for disease.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 Detect plant health using leaf images (Healthy / Unhealthy)
* 📷 Simple web interface to upload plant photos
* 💡 Gives plant care suggestions based on prediction
* 🧠 Built with a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* 🖥️ Works offline without requiring Azure or internet
* 📊 Future scope: support for more diseases, sensors, and voice interface

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Image Collection**
   - You gather images of plant leaves labeled as `healthy` or `unhealthy`

2. **Model Training**
   - A CNN model is trained using TensorFlow on this dataset

3. **Prediction**
   - The Streamlit app allows users to upload a leaf image
   - The model predicts the health status and gives suggestions

4. **Suggestion Engine**
   - Based on the output class (healthy/unhealthy), a care suggestion is shown to the user

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-plant-care.git
cd smart-plant-care
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare Dataset

Download and organize images into:

```
data/
├── healthy/
├── unhealthy/
```

You can get sample data from: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)

### 5. Train the Model

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/train_model.ipynb
```

Train and export the model to `model/plant_health_model.h5`.

### 6. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

---

## 🧑‍🌾 How to Use

1. Run the app using `streamlit run app/main.py`
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf through the web interface
3. View the predicted result (Healthy / Unhealthy)
4. Read suggested care actions
5. Optionally, enter light or moisture details for more accurate tips

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* 🪴 Detect specific plant diseases (multi-class model)
* 🌦️ Integrate weather API for environment-based care tips
* 🌡️ Use real sensors for moisture, temperature, pH
* 📱 Convert to mobile app using Streamlit Sharing or Flutter
* 🎙️ Voice assistant using Azure OpenAI (if available)
